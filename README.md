# Red-Wine-Quality
This is our project for SingleStore UCSB Datathon 2024 (1/26/24-1/29/24), our first datathon.

Our goal was to use data science models to analyze the relationship between the
different chemical properties of red wine, specifically the alcohol content (ABV), 
density, pH, and quality, using SingleStore's notebooks and Kaggle's Red Wine Quality dataset:
